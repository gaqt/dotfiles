# My Personal Rice

Still WIP and install script is untested, run at your own risk.

### Dependencies
- bspwm
- sxhkd
- picom
- lemonbar-xft-git
- kitty
- zsh
- ohmyzsh
- Kanit (included in files)
- ttf-firacode-nerd
- feh
- flameshot
- xclip
- xbindkeys
- dmenu
- sysstat
- acpi

If you're having trouble launching kitty because of OpenGL incompatibility (like I did),
you can try putting this into your .config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
```
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=true kitty
```
