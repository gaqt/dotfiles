# My Personal Rice

Still WIP, run at your own risk.

Supports bspwm and i3, moving to i3 though

### Dependencies
- bspwm
- sxhkd
- picom
- lemonbar-xft-git
- zsh
- mpv
- flameshot
- xclip
- xbindkeys
- dmenu
- sysstat
- acpi
- alacritty
- spleen-font
- nerd-fonts
- i3-wm
- i3status
- tmux
- feh
- dunst
- starship

### Notes

Since the install script runs 'chmod +x' on every file, there is
gonna be a bunch of unstaged files from permission changes, you can
get rid of this by running:
```
git config core.filemode false
```
