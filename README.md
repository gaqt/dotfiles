# My Personal Rice

Still WIP, run at your own risk.

### Dependencies
- bspwm
- sxhkd
- picom
- lemonbar-xft-git
- zsh
- ohmyzsh
- Kanit (included in files)
- ttf-firacode-nerd
- feh
- flameshot
- xclip
- xbindkeys
- dmenu
- sysstat
- acpi
- alacritty

### Notes

Since the install script runs 'chmod +x' on every file, there is
gonna be a bunch of unstaged files from permission changes, you can
get rid of this by running:
```
git config core.filemode false
```
