# My Neovim Config

### Introduction

This is my neovim config ^_^
It used to be more lightweight to run on old spec computers but i dont have
that limitaiton anymore, so now it includes a hefty load of plugins for
quality of life and utility.

This config works best in a full color terminal with a patched font selected.

This config uses the Lazy.nvim plugin manager.

### Dependencies

- cmake
- git
- a patched font
- ripgrep
